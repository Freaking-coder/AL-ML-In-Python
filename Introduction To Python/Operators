Operators are special symbols that help in carrying out an assignment operation or arithmetic or logical 
computation
Value that the operator operates on 
is called operand

Arithmetic operators
Symbol Operation Example
+ Addition  Used to perform mathematical operations between two 
operands

Assignment Operators(==,+=,/=,*=)
Relational Operators
Bitwise Operators
Logical Operators

Special Operators

Operators
Unary Operators
+, -, , /, //, * and % are known as operators and these operators can be unary or binary
A unary operator has only one operand
The unary - (minus) operator yields the negation of its numeric argument
The unary + (plus) operator yields its numeric argument unchanged
The unary ~ (invert) operator yields the bit-wise inversion of its plain or long integer argument

Identity operators
Identity operators are used to compare if two objects are same with the same memory location
They are usually used to determine the data type of a variable
The identity operators are 'is' and 'is not'
‘is’ operator - evaluates to true if the variables on either side of the operator
point to the same object and false otherwise

‘is not’ operator - evaluates to false if the variables on either side of the operator
point to the same object and true otherwise

Membership Operators
Membership operators are operators used to validate the membership of a value in a sequence
The membership operators are 'in' and 'not in'

'in' operator - checks if a value exists in a sequence or not
It evaluates to true if it finds a variable in the specified sequence and false
otherwise

‘not in’ operator - evaluates to true if it does not find a variable in the specified
sequence and false otherwise
